ðŸ“Œ Hi! I'm Nandini Bahirgonde. 


I'm a junior majoring in **Computer Science** at **Arizona State University**, with a passion for building technology thatâ€™s thoughtful, scalable, and human-centered. My academic and personal projects reflect a deep interest in the intersection of **web development**, **machine learning**, and **user experience design**.
Over the years, Iâ€™ve taken a hands-on approach to learning â€” diving into front-end tools like **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, strengthening my backend fundamentals, and exploring the possibilities of intelligent systems through **Python** and **AI frameworks**. Whether Iâ€™m designing a dynamic user interface or debugging logic behind an ML model, I enjoy solving problems with equal parts creativity and precision.
As someone who values teamwork and continuous learning, I love collaborating on meaningful projects, contributing to open-source communities, and constantly pushing myself to grow as a developer. Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities that will allow me to apply and deepen my skills while making an impact in real-world applications.
One of my greatest motivations for pursuing Computer Science in college is that it allows me to blend my technical skills with creativity. To me, this field opens a door full of opportunities, allowing me to design and develop codes, applications, and programs that are products of my own creativity and imagination ðŸ’Œ

Always looking forward to opportunities that allow me to learn, grow and contribute to innovative projects!
